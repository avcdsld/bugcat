# BUGCAT

A literary work of cats born through smart contracts, each bearing the wound of vulnerability.

The vulnerabilities that shook Ethereum’s history—reentrancy attacks, overflows, predictability—are carried forward and deployed as individual cat contracts. Anyone can interact with these cats. And when the conditions of their vulnerabilities are met, they let out a meow. Each one is connected to historical contracts still inscribed on Ethereum: The DAO, which lost 3.6 million ETH in 2016; the Parity Wallet library, which froze $280 million forever in 2017. The cats recall these traces, bearing witness to the existence of code.

They were not born of malice. Innocent structures, in the end, brought grief to many and fractured the world. Code once written like a game became embedded in the core of the economy, fitted with the collar of responsibility, and eventually erased.

BUGCAT is a work that makes reading code the condition of experience. Through the poetic structure of vulnerability, it depicts both the sorrow and the beauty of living alongside code.
