BUGCAT

This archive contains the human-readable source code of BUGCAT,
a series of smart contracts presented as code poetry.

The authoritative execution of these contracts exists as bytecode
on the Ethereum mainnet. The source code included here is provided
for reading and archival purposes only.

The primary reading interface for the work is:
https://bugcat.org

Interaction such as submitting transactions is not mandatory.
However, the work is structured so that reading naturally unfolds into the possibility of action, where interpretation becomes commitment.
